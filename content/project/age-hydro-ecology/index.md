In collaboration with [Dr. Bosco Rusuwa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahv9RywAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Malawi,
and [Dr. Maggie Munthali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KC8PJlsAAAAJ&hl=en) based at [MwAPata Institute](https://www.mwapata.mw/), we will conduct a longitudinal study (over 3 years) to identify components of the environment which cue for changes in the rate of aging in natural conditions.

A recent study addressed the question of how differential aging evolves in wild killifish colonizing ecologically different habitats. From this study, the hypothesis is that faster aging results from increased mutational loads triggered by episodes of relaxed selection, which is in agreement with evolutionary theory of aging. From a shorter-term perspective, we appreciate that water temperature increases gradually during pool desiccation, water chemistry may be more concentrated late and early in the season, and biotic factors including predation are involved. Which of these, or sub-components thereof, are critical triggers of the aging rate response?

We use a longitudinal study design to generate and integrate ecological and genomic time-series. In extreme climatic regions covering the range of each species, we designate at least 12 ephemeral pools of varying sizes. In these same pools, we sample components of the environment (hydro-ecological, water physico-chemical properties, benthic fauna and microbes, plant and animal communities including sources of predation). Field monitoring of these pools will proceed for a minimum of three years, with sampling at a monthly interval. Concurrently, we will estimate lifespan in the field as a proxy for the rate of aging. From these data, we will use dimension-reduction statistical methods to identify key environmental cues that correlate the most with killifish aging rates. Environmental components identified will be manipulated in more controlled conditions in a future project to dig deeper into the evolutionary dynamics of aging in natural populations.
