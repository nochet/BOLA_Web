In collaboration with [Dr. Bosco Rusuwa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahv9RywAAAAJ&hl=en) (University of Malawi),
and [Dr. Maggie Munthali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KC8PJlsAAAAJ&hl=en) (MwAPata Institute) (https://www.mwapata.mw/), we will conduct a longitudinal study (over 3 years) to identify components of the environment which cue for changes in the rate of aging in natural conditions.

A recent study addressed the question of how differential aging evolves in wild killifish colonizing ecologically different habitats. From this study, the hypothesis is that faster aging results from increased mutational loads triggered by episodes of relaxed selection, which is in agreement with evolutionary theory of aging. From a shorter-term perspective, we appreciate that water temperature increases gradually during pool desiccation, water chemistry may be more concentrated late and early in the season, and biotic factors including predation are involved. Which of these, or sub-components thereof, are critical triggers of the aging rate response?

We will identify variously sized ephemeral pools in arid and wet climatic regions for multiple species of killifish to monitor over a 3 year period. We will collect hydro-ecological, water quality, and benthic microbial data. Analysis of these data will help generate hypotheses and predictions that will later be tested in more controlled experiments.
