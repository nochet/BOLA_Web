African killifish have an annual life cycle. They are adapted to seasonal ephemeral water pools available only a few months each year, and remain desiccated for much of the year. This has placed an evolutionary constraint to complete an entire non-egg phase in a short time. Consequently, fish grow and mature rapidly to reproduce and leave eggs to overwinter in in the soil in diapause before the habitat disappears. The length of this naturally compressed lifespan varies widely within and between species, correlates with hydroperiod and the pace of aging. It presents a natural experiment suitable to probe the mechanisms of aging in multiple populations and species in ecological settings. We predict that variations in the rate of aging are influenced either by 1) the rate at which water temperature increases over the season, and/or 2) the rate at which pool size/water column depth decreases over the course of the habitat. 

To understand the agents and genomic targets of selection on aging rate in wild fish, we perform longitudinal comparative studies of habitat conditions and how these intersect with the rate of expression of the aging phenotype at molecular, physiological and behavioral levels. We follow twelve pools in arid vs humid habitats for each of four species: a) arid habitats tend to receive less annual precipitation, and pools dry faster, leading selection for shorter lifespan, earlier onset of aging, and a faster pace of aging; b) humid habitats select for longer lifespans and a slower pace of aging. Directly observing environmental dynamics in these ecotypes, measuring age-related traits, and integrating these data with omic data will enable us to propose novel mechanisms or refine existing mechanisms from an eco-genomics perspective.

### Critical environmental cues

Within and among species, African killifish differ widely in longevity and aging-associated traits based on climatic regions. The starting point in understanding underlying mechanisms for these differences is to investigate at a nuanced level, the environmental the factors that cue for variation in the response of aging rate in the wild. The BOLA Lab uses longitudinal ecological studies to associate water quality, fish demographic assessments, longevity, and aging phenotypes. This aim is accomplished by sampling multiple species, each presenting intra-specific variation in aging response to an aridity gradient transect from north-west Mozambique to southern Malawi. This project will identify the most important aspects of the environment that associate with the largest effect on the rate of aging.

### Targets of selection in natural populations
The focus of this project is to manipulate environmental cues in controlled conditions that select for the rate of aging in the wild. By integrating wild sample data with controlled-environment data, we hope to identify ecologically relevant aspects of the mechanism of aging. We use omic tools to localize target gene networks for selection on aging rate in natural populations. For example, whole genome sequencing, association and transcriptional analysis in fish of arid-wet ecotypes at multiple time points each year will help identify genes and pathways overlapping at least two methods to identify candidate mechanisms for functional testing. In parallel, we quantify age-related tissue damage and performance declines with age indicators of functional aging (including systemic biomarkers of aging such as advanced glycation products, and gut homeostasis in fish from low vs high mortality environments). Further interest for potential collaboration includes generating metabolomic and microbiome profiles for each population at various stages of life. These intermediate traits are closer to the whole-organism aging phenotype, and will be useful for integration with genetic and environmental cues for variation in the rate of aging.

### Mechanisms of aging in the lab vs in the wild
I will use draw-down experiments to gradually control water level in mesocosms to mimic pool drying in the wild and evaluate fish for the aging phenotype, life history, and markers of functional aging. In controlled-environments (tanks), I will test age-specific effects of water temperature (18 oC vs 28 oC) on muscle performance, age-related damage, and longevity. Transcriptomic profiling and DNA analysis will be carried out at juvenile, middle age, and old age to identify the genomic basis of the aging rate phenotype.

We are currently, 1) tracking genotype and haplotype frequency changes across the genome over evolutionary time, and 2) tracking a suite of allocation phenotypes such as genome-wide gene expression, the complete energy budget, lifespan, and weekly fecundity. As these phenotypes evolve in response to these treatments, we are characterizing corresponding changes across the genotype to phenotype map, providing an integrated, unprecedented look at microevolution in action. You can see an example of this evolution happening by looping the video below, which shows how haplotype frequencies change across one chromosome arm in one selection line over several generations.
