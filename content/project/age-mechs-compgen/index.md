Filtering eco-genomic data based on data derived from controlled experiments is a useful way to identify novel mechanisms. However, this approach asserts the superiority of a lab-based approach, which is the same way of doing things we want to vary from. A potentially better path is to attempt to input all data sets into the analysis pipeline (i.e., integration at analysis stage rather than post-analytic integration).
