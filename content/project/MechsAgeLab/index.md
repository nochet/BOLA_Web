African killifish have an annual life cycle. They are adapted to seasonal ephemeral water pools available only a few months each year, and remain desiccated for much of the year. This has placed an evolutionary constraint to complete an entire non-egg phase in a short time. Consequently, fish grow and mature rapidly to reproduce and leave eggs to overwinter in in the soil in diapause before the habitat disappears. The length of this naturally compressed lifespan varies widely within and between species, correlates with hydroperiod and the pace of aging. It presents a natural experiment suitable to probe the mechanisms of aging in multiple populations and species in ecological settings. We predict that variations in the rate of aging are influenced either by 1) the rate at which water temperature increases over the season, and/or 2) the rate at which pool size/water column depth decreases over the course of the habitat. 

To understand the agents and genomic targets of selection on aging rate in wild fish, we perform longitudinal comparative studies of habitat conditions and how these intersect with the rate of expression of the aging phenotype at molecular, physiological and behavioral levels. We follow twelve pools in arid vs humid habitats for each of four species: a) arid habitats tend to receive less annual precipitation, and pools dry faster, leading selection for shorter lifespan, earlier onset of aging, and a faster pace of aging; b) humid habitats select for longer lifespans and a slower pace of aging. Directly observing environmental dynamics in these ecotypes, measuring age-related traits, and integrating these data with omic data will enable us to propose novel mechanisms or refine existing mechanisms from an eco-genomics perspective.
