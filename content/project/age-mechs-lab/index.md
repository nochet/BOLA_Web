A major barrier to isolating genetic mechanisms for complex traits in wild populations is the difficulty to control for environmental conditions, and the out-crossed genomic landscape. To filter for candidate mechanisms with high probability of a true association with aging rate, we will rear non-lab adapted wet- vs arid-sourced fish in common garden for a few generations. The same battery of analysis performed in free-living fish will be repeated in high replication to yield a set of genes and gene networks that bear a consistent climatic signature of divergence in the aging rate.

In addition to completely controlled experiments, semi-controlled mesocosm-based experiments will be performed to provide an intermediate scenario. We will also attempt to simulate vernal pools in our mesocosms by founding populations in large tabs seeded with sediment, transfer the tabs into a green house with tropical temperatures during the winter months, and re-wetting the tables in spring for multiple years. In the event of success with this challenging, but promising approach, the mechanisms identified should be pretty close with the natural mechanism and should provide an opportunity to filter all data sets for a high quality candidate mechanism.
