I will use draw-down experiments to gradually control water level in mesocosms to mimic pool drying in the wild and evaluate fish for the aging phenotype, life history, and markers of functional aging. In controlled-environments (tanks), I will test age-specific effects of water temperature (18 oC vs 28 oC) on muscle performance, age-related damage, and longevity. Transcriptomic profiling and DNA analysis will be carried out at juvenile, middle age, and old age to identify the genomic basis of the aging rate phenotype.
