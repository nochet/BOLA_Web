The focus of this project is to manipulate environmental cues in controlled conditions that select for the rate of aging in the wild. By integrating wild sample data with controlled-environment data, we hope to identify ecologically relevant aspects of the mechanism of aging. We use omic tools to localize target gene networks for selection on aging rate in natural populations. For example, whole genome sequencing, association and transcriptional analysis in fish of arid-wet ecotypes at multiple time points each year will help identify genes and pathways overlapping at least two methods to identify candidate mechanisms for functional testing. In parallel, we quantify age-related tissue damage and performance declines with age indicators of functional aging (including systemic biomarkers of aging such as advanced glycation products, and gut homeostasis in fish from low vs high mortality environments). Further interest for potential collaboration includes generating metabolomic and microbiome profiles for each population at various stages of life. These intermediate traits are closer to the whole-organism aging phenotype, and will be useful for integration with genetic and environmental cues for variation in the rate of aging.
