In the BOLA, we collectively stand by the following values:

1) **Inclusion.** All are welcome in our lab. We will not exclude anyone due to race, ethnicity, citizenship, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status, or any other aspect of one’s identity. We will strive to create a lab community that allows all members to feel accepted, appreciated, and empowered as their authentic selves.

2) **Diversity & Equity.** Working with a diverse group of people exposes us to new ideas, increases our creativity, and broadens our perspectives, improving our ability to make scientific discoveries. As a part of our goal of maintaining a diverse research team, we will actively recruit lab members from PEER (persons excluded because of ethnicity or race) groups and other groups that have been historically excluded from Biology. We commit to treating each lab member as an individual with unique experiences and individual needs.   

3) **Anti-racism & Anti-oppression.** We stand against oppression in any form, at any level. We commit to continually striving to identify oppression where it exists and to actively challenge it as it occurs in our lab, our university, and our society. 

4) **Collaboration and Community.** We all have a lot we can teach one another and many ways we can help one another succeed. In our lab, we believe we can achieve more by working together and offering support to one another than by focusing solely on our own needs and achievements. We will strive to create a lab community where we actively share information and collectively work together toward the education and professional development of our lab members. Our lab should be a place where we can all count on one another for help and support. 

5) **Well-being.** The mental and physical health of our lab members is of utmost importance in our lab and should not be sacrificed in the name of productivity. We encourage everyone to strive for a healthy work-life balance, to set reasonable boundaries between the work in the lab and other parts of one’s life, and to devote time for breaks. 

6) **Open Science.** In our lab, we use a scientific worldview to inform how we learn about the natural world. Science is a powerful way of knowing and we believe it should be fully reproducible and accessible by all. We strive to make our research methods (including data, code, etc) available and easy to use, and to communicate our findings in open, accessible forums and we will welcome collaboration and communication with other research groups.
