This is the second paper I published in my former lab that strongly suggests that the mechanism of aging may be more complex in ecological populations than currently understood based on laboratory models. The study focused on understanding the mechanism of gene expression response that is induced by changes in diet. We used the DSPR to identify patterns of female differential gene expression and coexpression in three diets: high sugar (HS), dietary restriction (DR) and control (C); and three tissues: head, body and ovary. Our results indicte that a large number of different genes and pathways are involved in the transcriptional response to diet, and that this response cannot be well-understood by focusing soley on a few key genes.
