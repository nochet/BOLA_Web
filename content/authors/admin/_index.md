### About the lab

The Biology of Longevity and Aging (BOLA) Lab studies genetic mechanisms of differential aging rates focusing mainly on free-living and non-lab adapted populations. We apply integrative approaches across biological scales, environments, and species, to longitudinal studies of species response to habitat conditions.
