From this study, the hypothesis is that faster aging results from increased mutational loads triggered by episodes of relaxed selection, which is in agreement with evolutionary theory of aging. From a shorter-term perspective, we appreciate that water temperature increases gradually during pool desiccation, water chemistry may be more concentrated late and early in the season, and biotic factors including predation are involved. Which of these, or sub-components thereof, are critical triggers of the aging rate response?\n The schematic shows how historical demographic dynamics are likely to have let to the evolution of shorter lifespans and faster aging in dryer harsher conditions. Figure: Cui et al., 2019  We use a longitudinal study design to generate and integrate ecological and genomic time-series. In extreme climatic regions covering the range of each species, we designate at least 12 ephemeral pools of varying sizes. In these same pools, we sample components of the environment (hydro-ecological, water physico-chemical properties, benthic fauna and microbes, plant and animal communities including sources of predation). Field monitoring of these pools will proceed for a minimum of three years, with sampling at a monthly interval. Concurrently, we will estimate lifespan in the field as a proxy for the rate of aging. From these data, we will use dimension-reduction statistical methods to identify key environmental cues that correlate the most with killifish aging rates. Environmental components identified will be manipulated in more controlled conditions in a future project to dig deeper into the evolutionary dynamics of aging in natural populations.\n We will follow pools in wet vs dry regions focusing on four species in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

However, it is possible to take advantage of -omic advances, traditional genetic methods, and computational tools to push this interesting frontier. In this project, we focus on the same pools sampled for environmental conditions. Thus, for each species we compare arid vs humid fish in their rate of genomic and functional changes over three years. We collect fish at three time points along the desiccation timeline to provide multiple test tissues. Using differential gene expression for arid-wet conditions, whole-genome sequencing, genome-wide association mapping (GWAS), along with functional trait measurements (changes in tissue microbiomes across season, accumulation of tissue damage indicators, and swimming performance such as fatigue and swim distance), the goal is to understand the profile of network adaptation and allele frequency variation. These data will serve as the basis for comparison with similar data sets generated in in controlled conditions.

The same battery of analysis performed in free-living fish will be repeated in high replication to yield a set of genes and gene networks that bear a consistent climatic signature of divergence in the aging rate.\n In the lab, fish are reared in a state-of-the-art aquarium, complete with a self-cleaning technology.

In the event of success with this challenging, but promising approach, the mechanisms identified should be pretty close with the natural mechanism and should provide an opportunity to filter all data sets for a high quality candidate mechanism.\n Large tubs will be used to rear fish from late spring to early fall. A vast flat space is available for sitting of these tubs, and a greenhouse is located to the left in the image which will house simulated desiccated pools over winter months.
